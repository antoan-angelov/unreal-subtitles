00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,500
Party girls don't get hurt

1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,100
Can't feel anything, when will I<br/>learn?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,100
I push it down, push it down

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,800
I'm the one "for a good time<br/>call"

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,600
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my<br/>doorbell

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,700
I feel the love, feel the love

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,500
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,200
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,100
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,900
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

10
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:42,100
I'm gonna swing from the<br/>chandelier, from the chandelier

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm gonna live like tomorrow<br/>doesn't exist

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,100
Like it doesn't exist

13
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:04,300
I'm gonna fly like a bird<br/>through the night, feel my tears<br/>as they dry

14
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:15,100
I'm gonna swing from the<br/>chandelier, from the chandelier

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,300
But I'm holding on for dear<br/>life, won't look down, won't<br/>open my eyes

16
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,100
Keep my glass full until morning<br/>light, 'cause I'm just holding<br/>on for tonight

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Help me, I'm holding on for dear<br/>life, won't look down, won't<br/>open my eyes

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,000
Keep my glass full until morning<br/>light, 'cause I'm just holding<br/>on for tonight

19
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
On for tonight

20
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
Sun is up, I'm a mess

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Gotta get out now, gotta run<br/>from this

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,100
Here comes the shame, here comes<br/>the shame

23
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,700
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

24
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,400
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,300
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

26
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,200
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm gonna swing from the<br/>chandelier, from the chandelier

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,900
I'm gonna live like tomorrow<br/>doesn't exist

29
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,300
Like it doesn't exist

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm gonna fly like a bird<br/>through the night, feel my tears<br/>as they dry

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,700
I'm gonna swing from the<br/>chandelier, from the chandelier

32
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,700
But I'm holding on for dear<br/>life, won't look down, won't<br/>open my eyes

'Cause I'm just holding on for<br/>tonight

39
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,100
Oh, I'm just holding on for<br/>tonight
